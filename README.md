1. I believe that all aspects of my work have been correctly implemented. That is, index.html, bio.html, resume.html, and style_portfolio.css all follow the instructions and the pages have been verified by their respective W3C validator (i.e. https://validator.w3.org/ or https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

2. I worked on this project by myself.

3. I spent about 3-4 hours because I spent an excessive amount of time trying to perfect my lab portfolio; I allocated some time to making all my pages asthetically pleasing and some more time implement media queries.
