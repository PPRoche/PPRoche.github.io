1. I believe that all aspects of my work have been correctly implemented. That is, index.html, bio.html, resume.html, and style_portfolio.css all follow the instructions and the pages have been verified by their respective W3C validator (i.e. https://validator.w3.org/ or https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

2. I worked on this project by myself.

3. I spent about 3 hours completing the requirements of the assignment. Then, I spent the rest of the time trying to figure out how to implement media queries and how to make the website look asthetically pleasing. I also only found out, near the end, that I could have a live version of my html pages opened up on my regular browswer which could have saved me a significant amount of time with the stylization phase. That is, rather than having to waiting for github to load my page every time I made a change (i.e., git push, opened up https://pproche@github.io, and waited 2 mins, etc...), I could simply refresh a local version of my project. Although I spent an excessive amount of time trying to perfect my lab portfolio, I'm glad that I have a pretty solid foundation of css/html rules.
