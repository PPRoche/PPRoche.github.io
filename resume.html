		<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
		<h3>Tufts University, Professional Sleeper | Research Assistant</h3>
		<div class="date-loc">Feb 2016 - Present | Medford, MA</div>
		<p>Make fictional apps and studies where fellow students are payed to sleep in non-CS related classes. A tool that uses sensors to determine activity of beta waves of sleepy test subjects, and account for variation between boring and interesting classes.</p>

		<h3>Segment Fault Academy, Error Magnet | Case-study</h3>
		<div class="date-loc">Feb 2017 - Present | Medford, MA</div>
		<p>Participated in a study that attempted to find the most error-prone CS student throughout their classes and projects. Shockingly, they concluded that my ability to get even the most basic programs (e.g. Hello world program) to Segment Fault distinguished myself from other students. However, they were even more impressed by my self-proclaimed "Genius". Thus, I was awarded the title of the "Most Incompetent/Confident CS Student".</p>
